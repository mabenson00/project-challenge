# Bark Challenge

## Set Up
`bundle install` 
`rake db:reset`
go to localhost:3000

## Thought Process
Based on the limited amount of time, I did things in the simplest way I could (while trying to stick with the style that was already there). So, because you had JSON responses, I put JSON responses (etc).

I used [will-paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) for the pagination.

Some of the things I would do with more time:

 - Tests
 - Clean up sort, put in real scope.
 - Unliking.
 - Real permissions.
